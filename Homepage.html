    <h3><em>A meida and tech practitioner</em></h3>
    <p>
      I am Wancen Yang, a current graduate in Information Systems at Northeastern University. Before I joined this program, I also got my first Master's degree in public relations at Syracuse University and a bachelor's degree in communication at the University of International Relations, China. I have a passion for both media and tech. On this website, you can find my work in these two fields. Now, I have lived in the bay area for over two years after leaving for my hometown, Beijing. When I am free, I enjoy traveling and have visited over seven countries, including Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Portugal, and Spain.
